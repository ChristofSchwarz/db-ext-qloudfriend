# Qlik Cloud Developer's Friend Extension

### useful actions for Qlik Sense Developers when developing on Qlik Cloud

What this extension helps you with:

 - Set a intended state for every sheet: public or private
 - get **reminded of sheets in wrong state**
 - Publish/unpublish or delete sheets right from the extension itself 
 - **Reload button** in the UI with status info about the ongoing reload 
 - **Take app ownership**: You have enough rights in the space but you're not the app owner and therefore don't see the Load Script Editor / Data Manager? One click away
 - **Republish app** to a **managed space** with a click
